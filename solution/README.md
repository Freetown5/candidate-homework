# Front-end Challenge Solution#

Greetings, engineering hiring team at Inspire and thanks for taking the time to review my code challenge. In addition to what you requested in your instructions, I also decided to give this challenge a creative name, and add a wireframe to better showcase my thought process when it came to building this mini-app. I hope it's helpful for you when making your final decision for this position. Thanks again.

## Tool Justification ##
For this project I decided to use the Vue.js framework in order to take advantage of the templating, which is easier in this particular framework because it is most similar to wrting standard html, and many of the other tools. I also used Materialize, an external material UI library in order to take advantage of it's prem-made grid among other tools.
